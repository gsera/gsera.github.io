Bofie and I spent the afternoon making Claire.  I promised I would buy her a robot, and I ended up funding a kickstarter campaign:

It took several months to finally get the mBot, although I think she had forgotten about it (or at least didn't mention it) until this afternoon.

She was very good at constructing her new baby.  The instructions were decent, although not as good as Ikea.  Which screw to use was a bit confusing at times.  We managed to put it together after a couple of hours (with breaks in between).

I'm pretty happy that she was quite into making this, and the best was that we were able to find a CR-2025 battery sitting around to make the thing operate after we put the final pieces together.

I hope that she'll eventually play around with the mblock software too, which is supposed to be just like Scratch, with modifications for Arduino hardware elements and sensors.
